Hi, I'm Ori. I am about to graduate from Tel Aviv University with an MSc in Computer Science, advised by [Lior Wolf](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/).

I'm interested in unsupervised, elegant models that can represent the world in a meaningful way. In addition, I try to take existing models and make them work using less parameters, data, and supervision.

Previously, I completed my BSc degree at Tel Aviv University and briefly worked as a software developer.
