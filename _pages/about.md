Hi, I'm Ori! I'm a graduate student at the University of Tübingen and the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS), working in [Matthias Bethge's lab](https://bethgelab.org). 


I'm interested in unsupervised, elegant models that can represent the world in a meaningful way. In addition, I try to take existing models and make them work using less parameters, data, and supervision.

Previously, I graduated from Tel Aviv University with an BSc in Mathematics and an MSc in Computer Science, advised by [Lior Wolf](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/).

My brother [Ofir Press](https://ofir.io/) is an NLP researcher.
